# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm** using Python.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

Create a Python program that can:
- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Take user input for both message and shift value

---

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- Z → C (wraps around)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook (optional)

---
